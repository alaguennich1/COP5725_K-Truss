# COP5725_K-Truss
This repository contains the final project for the [COP5725 Advanced Database Systems](http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~zhao/cop5725/project.html). The final project was the implementation of the K-Truss decomposition algorithms described in [Truss Decomposition in Massive Networks] (http://vldb.org/pvldb/vol5/p812_jiawang_vldb2012.pdf).
The implementation contains the following K Truss decomposition:
* The basic decomposition algorithm proposed by [Cohen] (http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.505.7006&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
* The improved version of the in memory algorithm
* The efficient I/O algorithm Bottom up
* The In memory top-down decomposition
